Description: This project is a Personal Portfolio Website designed and developed using HTML and CSS to showcase a developer’s skills, projects, and achievements. The portfolio is built as a single-page responsive webpage with smooth navigation links that guide users to different sections such as Home, About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact.

The purpose of this project is to create an online presence for a developer where they can display their professional profile and share their work with potential employers, collaborators, or clients. The website uses clean and modern layout principles with a focus on responsive design, ensuring that the content adapts seamlessly across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

The codebase is simple and well-structured, using semantic HTML5 for better accessibility and CSS for styling and layout. Visual elements such as buttons, icons, and hover effects are used to enhance user experience. The project can be further enhanced with JavaScript for interactivity, animations, or integrating APIs like GitHub or LinkedIn.

Overall, this project serves as a strong foundation for any developer looking to build a personal brand and maintain a digital portfolio that reflects their technical skills and creative abilities.
